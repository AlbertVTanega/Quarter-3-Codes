Real-Life Connections: String Manipulation
1. Auto-capitalizing names
Programs use functions like capitalize() or title() to automatically change the first letter of a name to uppercase before saving it.

2. Checking password length
Programs use a length function (such as len()) to count the characters and check if the password meets the required length.

3. Separating an address
Programs use split() to divide the address into parts like barangay, municipality, province, and zip code based on spaces.

4. Standardizing names
Programs convert all names to lowercase using lower() and then apply title() so all names follow the same format.

📄 FA8 – Real-Life Connections: Date Manipulation
1. Sorting server logs
Date and time functions allow programs to arrange logs in the correct order based on when actions happened.

2. Calculating age
Programs subtract the birthdate from the current date to find a person’s age and send birthday reminders.

3. Calculating next billing date
Programs add days or months to the last payment date to automatically compute the next billing date.
